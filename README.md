Hi, I'm Bence

I'm a Junior Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Python, and Excel. I recently completed the CompTIA Data+ certification and have been building practical projects to strengthen my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation.

My background in operations and management has given me strong experience working with KPIs, performance data, and business processes. I enjoy working with real-world datasets, identifying patterns, and turning findings into clear, useful insights.

Technical Skills

SQL (joins, aggregations, CTEs)

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Excel (data cleaning, analysis, pivot tables)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data validation and preparation
